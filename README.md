This project is a simple to-do list application built using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Prisma/MySQL, Clerk Authentication, and Lucide Icons.

Overview
This project was my first experience with TypeScript, which contributed to a longer development timeline than anticipated. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Features
Create New Tasks: Add new tasks to your to-do list.

Check/Uncheck Tasks: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.

Authentication: Implemented Clerk Authentication for secure sign-in functionality.

Iconography: Used Lucide Icons to enhance the visual representation of task actions.

Technologies Used

TypeScript: Enhances code readability and provides static typing for improved developer experience.

Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering, routing, and API handling.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling the user interface.

Prisma/MySQL: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations with MySQL database.

Clerk: Provides secure authentication and user management features.

Lucide Icons: Simple and clean icons used for visual elements in the UI.
