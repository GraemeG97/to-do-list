# To-Do List App
This project is a basic to-do list application built using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Prisma/MySQL, Clerk Authentication, and Lucide Icons.

## Overview
This project was my first experience with TypeScript, which contributed to a longer development timeline than anticipated. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Features
- Create New Tasks: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Check/Uncheck Tasks: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- Authentication: Implemented Clerk Authentication for sign-in functionality.
